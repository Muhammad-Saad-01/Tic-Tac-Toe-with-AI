# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game,
here is the unbeatable implementation of it using Minimax Algorithm and Strategy Design Pattern.
this project was a part of my journey in Java Developer Track on JetBrains Academy.
